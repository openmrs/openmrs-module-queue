/**
 * Bean definition used for retrieving Queue Entries that meet specific criteria All properties

 * limit by the related property Any Collection that is empty will return only those results for
 * which the related property is null Any Boolean property without a default value will not limit if
 * the property is null For example, to not limit by priority, set the priority property to null To
 * limit to only those entries whose priority is null, set the priority property to an empty
